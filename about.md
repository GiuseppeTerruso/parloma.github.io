The PARLOMA project is aimed at creating a robotic system to allow remote communication between two deafblind people, a deafblind person to a deaf person and a deafblind person to a hearing person with a knowledge of sign language.

Deafblind people are unable to hear and see, generally they are born deaf, then they gradually become blind. As a matter of fact deafblind people first learn Sign Language (SL), then when they go blind they modify their way of communicating into Tactile Sign Language (TSL). The main drawback of this method is that the signer (*speaker*) and the receiver (*listener*) must be in the same place, one next to the other. Secondly, only one-to-one conversations are possible, because in TSL the *listener* has to touch and follow with his hands those of the sogner.

Nowadays there are three possible communication scenarios in which deafblind people can be involved:

 - deafblind person to deafblind person;
 - deafblind person to hearing/deaf person that can sign;
 - deafblind person to hearing person that cannot sign. In this case the deafblind person receives the message on their palm via a working glove, this solution is called the “Malossi system” or “writing on the palm”.

As described above, all these situations require the two people being in the same place, therefore this space-dependent communication strongly limits the interactions of deafblind with the rest of the world. In order to face this problem the goal of the project is design a system able to allow deafblind to remote communicate with the rest of the society.
