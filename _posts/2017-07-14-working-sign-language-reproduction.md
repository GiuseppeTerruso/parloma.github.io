Thanks to our teammate **Peppe Terruso**, we are ready to start comparing the capability of the PARLOMA Robot hand to reproduce handshapes from Italian Sign Language.

You can find some images below. In the next weeks, we will perform some experiments in order to understand if humans are able to correctly recognize the handshapes reproduced..
