# Parloma Robotic Hand Builds and Upgrades

In order to make some real-word human interaction trials, two of the Parloma robotic hand and forearm had been assembled. 
During the process, few parts of the overall system showed up to require some redisign due to poor functionality and/or lack of rubustness. Those upgrades are moslty about control communication, power supply distribution and the outer control box. 

## The Hand 
The hands, like much of the forearms, had been reproduced stright close to the original [Parloma model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:701446): 24 3D-printed PLA parts put together with glue, self-tapping M2 screws, 8mm alluminum/2mm steel joint axes and 45x3x0.3mm springs.

Post-processing the rpinted parts has been critical in order to make them fit together or slide in case of joints.   
Bowdens made out of teflon [(PTFE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene) has been used to route the artificial tendos through smooth paths within the palm end the forearm toward the motor's pulleys. 

## The Forearm
The outer structure of the forearm, the single-axis robotic wrist as well as the motors/bowdens support frame, are kept identical to the original [Parloma Project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:701494) 3D models.

At this point we've just stared to introduce some necessary improvements. Like the main servo motors that has been upgraded to a more fresh and a bit oversized option. Like the digital [MG996R](https://www.amazon.com/Qunqi-MG996R-Digital-Torque-Helicopter/dp/B014KONJZY/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1520184911&sr=8-5&keywords=MG996R), capable of 11Kg/cm of torque with more overall mechanical and thermal stability then their analogue counterparts. 

Servos power supply distribution and conditioning circuit has been inproved as well, leveraging few miniaturized DC-DC step-down [power converters](https://www.amazon.com/eBoot-MP1584EN-Converter-Adjustable-Module/dp/B01MQGMOKI/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1520169701&sr=8-7&keywords=Buck+Converter+DC+DC+Step+Down), one for each couple of motors, integrated within the forearm and connected in parallel to the robot's 12V power input.
