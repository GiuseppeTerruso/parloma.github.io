the most important Maker Event in Europe.

The Maker Faire Rome is an important appointment for our team since 2014, when
we first participated to the event thanks to Telecom Italia. During the MFR 2015 we
had the strong pleasure to meet Gael Langevin, father of the [InMoov project](http://inmoov.fr/)
a super nice Open Source Project that was our starting point to the development of
our Hand.

Since then, our team (and me in particular), started to participated repeadtly to
the different (mini) Maker Faires all over the Italy. We was at Maker Faire Rome 2015, at mini Maker Faire Torino 2015 and at mini Maker Faire Trieste 2016. We were not able, as Parloma project, the Maker Faire Rome 2016, even if I was there with an other project (DotBot). And we are happy to come back with our hand this year!

I hope to find lot of old and new friends next December,

see you all in Rome!
